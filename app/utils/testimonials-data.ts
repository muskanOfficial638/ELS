      "“I couldn't have asked for a better legal partner to help bring my innovative non-profit in the adtech space to life. Syeda's expertise, attention to detail, and understanding of the unique needs of my organization were truly exceptional. From the very beginning, she provided bespoke legal advice, helping me determine the right entity structure and handling all the corporate formation documents and policies flawlessly.What really stood out was her ability to go beyond just the legal paperwork. Syeda connected me with experts in spaces like non-profit tax and accounting, and even helped secure trademarks through an IP expert, ensuring I had everything in place to launch and scale my non-profit successfully. Her support has been invaluable, and I’m thrilled to continue working with her as outside counsel as we grow. If you need a corporate lawyer who not only delivers top-notch work but truly cares about the long-term success of your organization, Syeda is the one to call.”",
